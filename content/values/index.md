					<p class="lead">In Europe, if they need to build a bridge, it has to be functional and beautiful…something that delights you as you’re driving across it. Out here in the western U.S., most of the time we just build a generic, boring bridge. If we’re going to build a world-changing product, let’s also make it beautiful.</p>

					<p class="lead">Technology exists to make our lives better. If our interactions with it are frustrating then really our lives just become more, well...frustrating. For tech to serve it’s purpose interactions must be at the very least simple and relevant. If there’s an opportunity to make the interactions seem magical, we need to take it.</p>

					<p class="lead">By nature UX is never done, because it can never be perfect. There is always something we can learn about the users to serve them better–we know in part, so we design in part. With each iteration we’re aiming for improvements, not perfection. I like to ask, “does this iteration serve the user better than the last?”.</p>
