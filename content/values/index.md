					<p class="lead">A successful user experience is rooted in understanding the users through things like user research, analytics and usability testing. By taking the time to understand the users, a wealth of information is revealed that can then be used to make great design decisions.</p>

					<p class="lead">In Europe, if they need to build a bridge, it has to be functional and beautiful…something that delights as you’re driving across it. Out here in the western US, most of the time we just build a generic, boring bridge. If we’re going to build a world-changing product, let’s also make it beautiful.</p>

					<p class="lead">Technology exists to make our lives better. If our interactions with it are frustrating then really our lives just become more, well...frustrating. For tech to serve it’s purpose interactions must be at the very least simple and relevant. If there’s an opportunity to make the interactions seem magical, we need to take it.</p>

				<div class="col-sm-4">
					<p class="lead">By nature UX is never done, because it can never be perfect. There is always something we can learn about the users to serve them better–we know in part, so we design in part. With each iteration we’re aiming for improvements, not perfection. I like to ask, “does this iteration serve the user better than the last?”.</p>

				<p class="libre">“User experience is a commitment to developing products and services with purpose, compassion, and integrity. It is the never-ending process of seeing the world from the customers’ perspective and working to improve the quality of their lives. It is the never-ending process of maintaining the health of the business and finding new ways to help it grow sustainably. It is the perfect balance between making money and making meaning."</p>
